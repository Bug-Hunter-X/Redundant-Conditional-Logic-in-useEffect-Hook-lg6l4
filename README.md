# Redundant Conditional Logic in useEffect Hook

This repository demonstrates a common error in React's `useEffect` hook: redundant conditional logic that can lead to unexpected behavior or unnecessary re-renders.

## Bug Description
The original code contains an `if/else if/else` statement inside a `useEffect` hook.  The `else if (count === 0)` condition is redundant because the first `if` statement already covers the case where `count` is greater than 0. This unnecessary condition increases complexity and reduces readability.  Additionally, it might introduce subtle bugs if the conditions are not precisely defined.

## Solution
The solution simplifies the conditional logic by removing the redundant `else if` statement.  The code now only checks if `count` is greater than 0, and provides a default message for all other cases. This improves code clarity and reduces the chances of unexpected behavior.
